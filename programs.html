        My favorite hobby is programming. I have exposure with a wide variety of languages, with the languages I am most
        proficient in bolded:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Java</b></li>
        <li>C++</li>
        <li>C#</li>
        <li><b>GML</b></li>
        <li>TI Basic</li>
        <li>Lua</li>
        <li><b>Python</b></li>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If block programming languages are counted as "real" languages, I can add a few more to the list:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Scratch</li>
        <li>Lego Mindstorms EV3</li>
        <li>MCreator</li>

    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
        At SCHS, a student going into Computer Science is expected to take AP Computer Science Principles sophomore year,
        AP Computer Science A junior year, and Game Design senior year. The technology teacher, Mrs. Sweeny, noticed that
        I was far ahead of anyone else at the school, and allowed me to take AP Computer Science A my sophomore year,
        skipping AP Computer Science Principles. I then learned Java my junior year.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like Java. It's not my favorite language, mostly because I haven't used a good game engine using it. I definitely
        prefer statically typed over dynamically typed languages, though. I also found the object-oriented nature of the
        language intuitive and helpful.
    </p>
    <h2>Electron Configuration Calculator</h2>
    <p>
        After I had learned the basics, my first program in Java was an electron configuration calculator. I did this mainly
        to study for Chemistry I. It worked, because after a whole year, I still know how to determine an electron
        configuration by heart.

    <h1>C# with Unity</h1>
    <p>
        I very much liked Unity. I think the syntax of C# and built-in systems offered by Unity make this my favorite
        system, though I haven't gotten arround to using it as much as I would've liked to. I have but one project to show
        made in Unity.
    </p>

    <!--#region Lua-->
    <h1>Lua</h1>
    <p>
        My experience with Lua comes from its use in Roblox, as well as a few other embedded software systems. I didn't put
        much effort into learning this language, as its 1-based indexing system and overly user-friendly syntax threw me
        off. I found the free server systems used by Roblox Studio to be slow and unreliable. I am also not a fan of the
        audience a roblox games would get, that being an audience of young children.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing I really liked about Lua in Roblox is the fact that variables can reference functions, and functions can
        be table elements. This was an interesting element of the language to use.

            "Doomspire Brickbattle" is a free asset available on Roblox Studio. It is essentially a finished game, and thus
            many have published the same game under different names that are all essentially copies of Doomspire
            Brickbattle. I thought it would be good practice for me to do something similar, but I couldn't publish
            publish someone else's work as my own. I created my own map similar to the Doomspires, created my own game
            progress tracking and restarting code, and tested with friends. I did not create my own weapons entirely from
            scratch, though.

            This game obviously takes inspiration from the Backrooms. This was mainly a project to help me learn the 
            programming language, as I created the game entirely from scratch, only using 3D models and 2D art from the
            Toolbox. For that reason, it isn't a very impressive project. I abandoned it mostly because I realized I 
            couldn't sell any gamepasses to go along with the game without breaking copyright law.

    <h1>GML</h1>
    <p>
        GML stands for GameMaker Language, used in GameMaker Studio 2 and not much else. It is an imperative,
        dynamically typed, object-oriented language, similar in nature to Python, but with some features in common with
        Lua. I very much liked GML because of the built-in systems it had, and I found the syntax easy to use and
        understand while not being too shallow as to be boring.

            Use the arrow keys or WASD to move, and press R to restart. Each color has a different effect on the

            This was originally intended to be an alpha version of a game still in development.

            Press m to chose singleplayer or multiplayer. Default is singleplayer. Player 1 uses arrow keys and
            Player 2 uses a and d.<br>
            Game speed starts on Normal, though the AI is significantly worse on Fast mode, and sometimes makes simple
            mistakes on Slow mode! <br>
            The High Score is the highest amount of points anyone has ever had over the AI, but it will only work
            properly when on the website and logged in.
