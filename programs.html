            Fish Bobble is a game that I made with Team 7 at Carnegie Mellon University's National High School Game 
            Academy. We were given a week to make our version of the arcade game Puzzle Bobble.

            In Fish Bobble, you play as a pixel art fish protecting a sand castle: your home. Shoot bubbles at the
            approaching clumps, matching sets of 3 to pop them! Look out for bombs!
          </p>
          <p>
            I worked on the game after NHSGA as well. Once I remove all the bugs, I'll publish it on Itch.

                and health. It taught me how to use GUI elements, scene management, and animations. Once I had learned how to 
                use Unity, I developed 3 new enemy types, a detailed inventory system, weapon types, weapon collectables, a 
                level system, and a better enemy spawning system.

    <h1>Java</h1>
    <p>
        At SCHS, a student going into Computer Science is expected to take AP Computer Science Principles sophomore year,
        AP Computer Science A junior year, and Game Design senior year. The technology teacher, Mrs. Sweeney, noticed that
        I was far ahead of anyone else at the school, and allowed me to take AP Computer Science A my sophomore year,
        skipping AP Computer Science Principles. I then learned Java my sophomore year.
    </p>
    <p>
        I like Java. It's not my favorite language, mostly because I haven't used a good game engine using it. I definitely
        prefer statically typed over dynamically typed languages, though. I also found the object-oriented nature of the
        language intuitive and helpful.

            After I had learned the basics of Java, my first program was an electron configuration calculator. I did this mainly

    <p>
        My experience with Lua comes from its use in Roblox, as well as a few other embedded software systems. I didn't put
        much effort into learning this language, as its 1-based indexing system and overly user-friendly syntax threw me
        off. I found the free server systems used by Roblox Studio to be slow and unreliable. I am also not a fan of the
        audience a roblox games would get, that being an audience of young children. Because of the legal situation of 
        Roblox, I will never return.
    </p>
    <p>
        One thing I really liked about Lua in Roblox is the fact that variables can reference functions, and functions can
        be table elements. This was an interesting element of the language to use.

                "Doomspire Brickbattle" is, or was, a free asset available on Roblox Studio. It is essentially a finished 
                game, and thus
                many have published the same game under different names that are all essentially copies of Doomspire
                Brickbattle. I thought it would be good practice for me to do something similar, but I couldn't publish
                publish someone else's work as my own. I created my own map similar to the Doomspires, created my own game
                progress tracking and restarting code, and tested with friends. I did not create my own weapons entirely from
                scratch, though.

                This game takes inspiration from the Backrooms. This was mainly a project to help me learn the
                programming Lua language, as I created the game entirely from scratch, only using 3D models and 2D art 
                from the Toolbox. I'll admit, though, isn't a very impressive project. I abandoned it mostly because 
                I realized I couldn't sell any gamepasses to go along with the game without breaking copyright law.

        GML stands for GameMaker Language, used in GameMaker Studio 2 and not much else. It is an imperative,
        dynamically typed, object-oriented language, similar in nature to Python, but with some features in common with
        Lua. I very much liked GML because of the built-in systems it had, and I found the syntax easy to use and
        understand while not being too shallow.

                A very creatively named game, "Gun Guy" was the last one I ever made with GameMaker Studio before moving on to
                Unity. I moved away from GML because I realized that I had no ability to compile GameMaker Studio games to
                executables, as that requires an expensive liscence. Unfortunately, that means I can't share the ability to play
                this game on this website. The best I can give is a YouTube video about the gameplay.
